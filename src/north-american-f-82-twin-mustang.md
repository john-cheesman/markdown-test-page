The **North American F-82 Twin Mustang** was the last American piston-engine fighter ordered into production by the [United States Air Force][1]. Based on the [P-51 Mustang][2], the F-82 was originally designed as a long-range escort fighter in World War II; however, the war ended well before the first production units were operational.

In the postwar era, Strategic Air Command used the planes as a long-range escort fighter. Radar-equipped F-82s were used extensively by the Air Defense Command as replacements for the [Northrop P-61 Black Widow][3] as all-weather day/night interceptors. During the [Korean War][4], Japan-based F-82s were among the first USAF aircraft to operate over Korea. The first three North Korean aircraft destroyed by U.S. forces were shot down by F-82s, the first being a North-Korean [Yak-11][5] downed over [Gimpo Airfield][6] by the USAF [68th Fighter Squadron][7].
